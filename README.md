# IOTVehicleGenerator
C# .NET DEMO application to generate IOTVehicleGenerator data and then SEND to an AZURE Event Hub

This C# Program can be easily modified to create a vehicle IOT Data Generator solution.  It will create a JSON payload of vehicle IOT data (based on random readings) and then will SEND the message to an Azure Service Bus.  Note that random VIN numbers and models are generated from the CSV file  VINMasterList.csv and VINRefData.csv.
